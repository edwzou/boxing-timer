# Boxing Timer

This Python application uses Pygame to create a customizable boxing timer for workout and rest intervals.

## Features

- Set the number of working sets and rest periods.
- Specify duration for each working set and rest period in minutes.
- Specify a warmup time in seconds to prepare before the first working set.
- Audio cue (`sound.mp3`) plays at the end of each working set.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

## Usage

1. Install Python and Pygame if not already installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the `timer.py` file.
3. Run `timer.py`.
4. Enter the warmup time in seconds, number of working sets, duration per working set, and duration per rest set when prompted.
5. Follow the countdown and audio cues for each interval.

## Example

```bash
python timer.py
